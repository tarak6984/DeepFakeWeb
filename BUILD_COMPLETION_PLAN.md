## Action Plan
1. Continue adding sections to BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH.md in batches
2. Add each file with complete source code
3. Organize by logical sections (UI components, pages, API routes, etc.)
4. Update the completion summary when all files are added

## Total Files to Complete
- **Completed**: ~25 files
- **Remaining**: ~65 files
- **Target**: 100% complete BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH guide

This will make the BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH.md file the definitive, complete source code reference for recreating the entire deepfake detection project.
